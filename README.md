### Title Fetcher

Create a web form that allows a user to type in a url to any website and have it then output the Title of that website on the same page. For example, if I typed in CNN.COM into the text input of the web page, it would spit out:

> CNN - Breaking News, Latest News and Videos

The application should consist of a javscript/html/css front end, and a backend API that fetches the page title.

You may use your preferred language for developing. Our preferred languages at chatmeter are scala and javascript.

Make sure that the application can be run with minimal set up.

This task should take you somewhere around 4 hours. You will present the application during your next interview.

**Bonus points:**
- Use React or any other front end web framework for the web form (Vue, Angular, Ember, etc.)
- Write the API server in scala or node.js
- Make it look great. Styling with Bootstrap is preferred
